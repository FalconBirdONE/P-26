**Instructions**
1.0 Prep the onion, garlic, ginger, and any vegetables you are using first.
1.1 Heat the olive oil or coconut oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, minced 1.1.2 garlic, and grated ginger, and a good pinch of salt and stir frequently until the onions are just softened.
1.3 Add the curry powder and give everything a good stir so the onions, garlic, and ginger are coated in the powder.
1.4 Add the coconut milk, 1/2 cup of water, and the vegetables you are using (see notes) and reduce heat slightly. Cook until the vegetables are just softened, about 10-15 minutes total, adding more water if the mixture begins to thicken too much (I usually add another 1/2 cup). If you are using cooked protein or cooked beans, add them last and cook until just warmed through.
1.5 Season with a healthy amount of salt, to taste (don’t be shy – this recipe needs it!).
1.6 Serve with cooked brown rice or quinoa, if desired, and top with any toppings you like.
